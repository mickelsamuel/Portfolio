# Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This Portfolio Website is a personal project designed to showcase my skills and projects as a Computer Engineering student. It serves as an interactive and detailed online resume, featuring sections on my education, skills, personal and academic projects, and contact information.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive elements like the expandable project boxes and dynamic navigation highlighting.

## Viewing the Project
The website can be viewed in two ways:

1. By cloning the repository and opening the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
   
   `git clone https://github.com/mickelsamuel/Portfolio.git`

2. Directly through the hosted version available at: [https://mickelsamuel.github.io/Portfolio/](https://mickelsamuel.github.io/Portfolio/)

### Note on Mobile Compatibility
The website is still in the process of being optimized for mobile devices. While it's fully functional on desktop, some features and layouts may not yet be perfectly adapted for smaller screens. Work is ongoing to enhance mobile responsiveness and usability.
